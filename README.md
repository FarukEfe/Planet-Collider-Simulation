**Planet Collider Simulation** is a personal experimental project that simulates real-life Newtonian Planetary Gravity. Each planet has randomized values of size and mass, which affect their gravity. When the rigidbodies collide close enough to one another, their sizes add up to form a bigger shape. 

In the program you can see how multiple rigibodies gain different momentum, swing/rotate around one another and collide.

Here's a video from the program:
